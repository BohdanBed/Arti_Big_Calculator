						<h2>CLIENT SERVICES AGREEMENT</h2>

							<div class="row__agreement">
								
								<p>CLIENT SERVICES AGREEMENT<br> This Agreement is entered into between the Seneca West, LLC dba ERC Expedited (“Service Provider”), and the undersigned party (“Client”). Each Client and the Service Provider are referred to herein individually as “Party” and collectively as “Parties.” The Parties agree to the following terms:</p>
								<h6>Parties agree to the following terms:</h6>
								<p>1.	Service Provider will work with Client to identify Client’s qualified locations and employees for Employee Retention Tax Credits, (“ERC” or “ERTC”). This is not an engagement of the Service Provider for general representation and Service Provider’ representation is limited to this issue.</p>
								<p>2.	Service Provider will work with Client to prepare and calculate Client’s ERTC claim based upon data and information received from the Client.</p>
								<p>3.	Service Provider will work with Client to prepare and deliver the ERTC package to Client with any applicable supporting schedules based on Client’s data and information.</p>
								<p>4.	Service Provider will represent, aid, and assist Client in the calculation of and application for ERTC and will assist in the delivery of necessary documents and information to the Internal Revenue Service, (“IRS”), regarding federal tax credits.</p>
								<p>5.	Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving the other party 30-days’ written Notice. Upon termination, Client shall pay all Invoices for work completed or, if termination is by the Client, on all work in progress at the time of the termination. This paragraph shall survive the termination of this Agreement.</p>
								<p>6.	Service Provider are not a tax preparer and are not engaged to prepare or consult regarding tax matters beyond those directly related to the ERTC. Service Provider disclaim responsibility for preparation of or consulting about Client’s federal and/or state tax returns except those documents filed in connection with Client’s ERTC claim as described herein. If Service Provider determine Client’s ERTC claim is reasonable and allowed per applicable regulations, the claim will be submitted to the IRS, for consideration. The ERTC claim may still be rejected by the IRS. Firm makes no guarantee of the ultimate merit of Client’s claim.</p>
								<p>7.	Client shall pay Service Provider a contingency fee, (“Fee”), calculated as 15% of the total Employee Retention Tax Credits eligible from the IRS Service Provider by Client for claims over $200,000. The contingency fee, for claims under $200,000 will be 18%.</p>
								<p>8.	Client shall pay Service Provider a contingency success fee, (“Success Fee”) calculated as 3% of the total Employee Retention Tax Credit eligible from the IRS by the client if client chooses to accelerate the Employee Retention Tax Credit.</p>
								<p>9.	Service Provider will present Client an Invoice for the Fee based on the ERTC as presented to the IRS by or on behalf of the Client. The Invoice(s) shall be paid by Client to the Service Provider within 5 calendar days following Client’s receipt of payment from the United States Department of Treasury, the IRS or any third party source who buys or advances the ERTC funds. This paragraph shall survive termination of this Agreement. If the amount eventually allowed to Client by the IRS or involved governmental authority is different from the amount calculated by Service Provider, then the Fee shall be adjusted to reflect the difference, either by increase or decrease; provided, that in the case of a reduction in the amount allowed, Service Provider must be given the opportunity to defend the correctness of the claimed ERTC.</p>
								<p>10.	Client agrees to promptly submit complete and truthful data to Service Provider and to cooperate in the production, presentation, and defense of all claims for ERTC. Client will further aid Service Provider in gathering information and will take such actions as Service Provider deem reasonable or desirable in evaluating, preparing, filing and, if needed, defending Client’s ERTC claim(s). Client certifies the accuracy of all data and information provided by Client that is included within or forms the basis of Client’s ERTC claim, and Client will defend and hold harmless Service Provider in the event any data or information is false.</p>
								<p>11.	Any Notice required or permitted under this Agreement is deemed given to the other party when personally delivered to the other party, when delivered by a recognized express delivery courier, or when sent by first class mail, proof of mailing provided by the United States Postal Service, postage prepaid, to the other Party at the address set forth herein or the business address of the other party.</p>
								<p>12.	If Client is legally required to repay any portion of the ERTC previously received, Service Provider will refund a prorated portion of the Fee attributed to that portion of the ERTC that was repaid to the IRS or the appropriate taxing authority; provided that Client shall have actually paid the Fee to Service Provider and Service Provider are given sufficient Notice of the audit or challenge by the IRS or appropriate taxing authority or of any other proceeding for review of the ERTC and afforded an opportunity to defend Client’s eligibility for, the validity of and/or the amount of the ERTC claimed by Client. For instance, if Client received a ERTC award of $100,000 but $50,000 is later disallowed and ultimately repaid by Client, then, of the Service Provider $25,000 Fee, Service Provider will repay $12,500 as the 50% prorated amount.</p>
								<p>13.	This agreement touches interstate commerce. Any dispute that arises out of or relates to this Agreement will be decided by binding arbitration in Dallas, Texas, by a single disinterested arbitrator, (Arbitrator), including the scope of the arbitration. Notice of demand for arbitration shall be made by either Party to the other Party(ies) and shall state the matter to be arbitrated. If the Parties do not agree on an arbitrator in 15 days, then the Presiding Circuit Judge of Dallas County, Texas will appoint the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall set the schedule, limits of discovery, and conduct all hearings and other presentations. The Arbitrator’s decision and/or award shall be in writing and is final. Each Party may have counsel at the Party’s expense and each Party shall pay half the expense for the arbitration; provided, however, that, if Client receives payment of the Employee Retention Tax Credits, but fails to pay Service Provider’ invoice for services, Client shall pay all costs of collection, including the attorney fees, discovery costs and arbitration expenses. There shall be no class action arbitration and no consolidation of more than one arbitration. Judgment on any arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
								<p>This agreement is automatically accepted and enforceable when the Client Party via electronic signature.</p>
								<p>Your electronic signature will be used on the 941 Tax forms for submission to the IRS.</p>
